# List of buttons and their function


## Touchscreen buttons
These are the buttons that are used as the fixid for on-screen buttons. In most cases these do not need sent to the gateway.
These could be used as physical button inputs. This would allow triggering the touchscreen button actions from a physical button.

### TSBTN1, TSBTN2
TSBTN1/2 are the fixids assigned to the BARO down and up buttons. Does not need sent to other gateways
