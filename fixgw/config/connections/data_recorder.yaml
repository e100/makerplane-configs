# Flight Data Recorder
data_recorder:
  # You can playback recorded data using the data_recorder.yaml config, you will need to edit it and specify what files you
  # want it to playback
  # OR, you can start fix gateway using the same config used to record with and add the CLI option
  # --playback-start-time 2024-02-10:19:59:50
  # Using the cli option, if logs for the time specified exist it will start playing them back and continue onto 
  # subesquent hour log files. When it reaches a gap in the files or if no logs exist for the time it will exit.
  load: yes
  module: fixgw.plugins.data_recorder
  # key_prefixes define the specific dbkeys that you want to record.
  # If you want to log all keys specify 'key_prefixes: all'
  # If you only want to log some dbkeys specify and array of prefixes you want to record.
  # Any key starting with the prefix will be logged. ie CHT would record CHT11, CHT12, CHTMAX1, etc etc
  #key_prefixes: [ CHT, EGT, GS, IAS, ALT, HEAD, TRACK ,PITCH, ROLL, YAW, ALAT, ALONG, LAT, LONG, TIMEZH, TIMEZM, TIMEZS ]
  key_prefixes: all
  # How often in ms should data be recorded
  # 200-250ms results in smoother playback
  # higher numbers typically produce smaller files
  frequency: 500 #ms
  # Once file is produced for each hour.
  # Each time the fix gateway is started during that hour it will record the frequency set above
  # The data_playback plugin will adjust playback according the that setting changes even if
  # it happens mid-file.
  # The files are named using the data: YYYY-MM-DD.HH.json
  # The files are stored into a directory structure to organize them into a useful structure.
  # The folder paths are YYYY/MM/DD/ 
  # With the example filepath below a file generated in the 21st hour of 2024-02-08 would be stored as:
  # {CONFIG}/../fdr/2024/02/08/2024-02-08.21.json2024-02-08.21.json
  # {CONFIG} is the path to this file, if this file was located at:
  # ~/.makerplane/fixgw/config/default.yaml
  # The example fdr file above would be located at:
  # ~/.makerplane/fixgw/fdr/2024/02/08/2024-02-08.21.json2024-02-08.21.json
  filepath: "{CONFIG}/../fdr"
